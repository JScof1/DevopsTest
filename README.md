# DevopsTest
Code repository for the Devops Test

Uses a Windows11 Batch file to run commands through a previously installed docker.
Make sure the docker daemon is running. (opening docker after starting the machine should work)
My git is set up to change line endings linux style, and that might need to be adjusted depending on your environment.
Ensure Spaceship_Pilots.py is in the same directory you run Spaceship_Pilots.bat from.

To run, execute the batch file Spaceship_Pilots.bat
